- Auth with Client credentials and Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant (Identity Server 4)
- Integration Tests with Consumer Driven Contracts (Pact)
- Distributed Logging with ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Complex Microservices with DDD and basic microservices with CQRS
- Relational database (PostgreSQL)
- Cache (Redis) 
- NoSQL (Cosmosdb) 
- Docker and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) deployment
- Health Checks with Prometheus and Grafana or Watchdog
